                The sums generated from transaction taxes and trading fees are
                used to buy back POSI tokens from exchanges. Those tokens are
                burnt in order to reduce the overall POSI tokens circulation,
                stabilize the token price and create deflation.

                Position Exchange is owned and operated by its community as a
                decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The Position
                Exchange protocol is subject to a democratic and transparent
                voting system that enables POSI token holders to get involved
                and shape the future of Position Exchange.

                Generate passive income by providing Liquidity or depositing
                your POSI tokens. POSI holders can stake the tokens into the
                staking pools to receive rewards. Staking indirectly serves to
                support the system. Position Exchange is implementing RFI
                Technology allowing rewards generation simply by HODLing POSI
                tokens. Applying a 1% fee to each transaction and distributing
                it to all token holders.
